## SESSION 03 - Assignment - DUE WEDNESDAY 9/17

## Short Sketch #1 - Digital Output
Create an Arduino sketch for the ESP32-S3 Dev Board implementing digitalWrite(). Program the microcontroller to display distinct On/Off patterns for the LEDs over time.   
The Project Must Include:
- a circuit with at least 4 LEDs including current limiting resistors.
- declaration and use of at least 3 variables.
- use of at least two conditional [if / else] statements.
- use of delay() function.
- use of logical comparator in at least one conditional statement.
- must display at least 6 unique LED patterns.

Upload your completed Short Sketch Project Folder to your GitHub repo with the title "YourName_SS1" (mine would be "IanP_SS1") before the next class session.    
The arduino .ino file must be in a folder of the same name. For example, the arduino .ino file "IanP_SS1.ino" goes into a folder named "IanP_SS1".

Send me the the link to your GitHub repo (URL, not .git) via Discord if you have not already done so. This is where I will check for your completed work from now on.
