## SESSION 04 - Assignment - DUE WEDNESDAY 10/8

## Short Sketch #2 - Digital Input
Create an Arduino sketch for the ESP32-S3 Dev Board implementing digitalRead(). Program the microcontroller to display & change LED patterns using push button(s). It is up to you to decide exactly how the logic is implemented, but the displayed LED pattern should be dependent on and/or affected by the pressing of button(s).    
For an extra challenge, consider using more than a single button event (Rising Edge, Pressed, Falling Edge) per button. For instance, two buttons can yield six distinct events, and could all be logically compared to one another.

Must Include:
- a circuit with a minimum of 4 LEDs, including current limiting resistors.
- declaration and use of at least 3 variables.
- use of at least two conditional [if / else] statements.
- use of logical comparator in at least one conditional statement.
- at least one pushbutton.
- use of digitalRead(), digitalWrite(), and pinMode() functions.
- display of at least 6 unique LED patterns.

Send me the the link to your GitHub repo for this class (URL, not .git) via Discord (or email) if you have not already done so. This is where I will check for your completed work from now on!

Upload your completed Short Sketch Project Folder to your GitHub repo with the title "YourName_SS2" (for example "IanP_SS2") before the next class session.    
The arduino .ino file must be in a folder of the same name. For example, the arduino .ino file "IanP_SS2.ino" goes into a folder named "IanP_SS2".

### REMINDER:

No Class Sessions for the next two weeks: 9/24 & 10/1   
We will resume on 10/8.
