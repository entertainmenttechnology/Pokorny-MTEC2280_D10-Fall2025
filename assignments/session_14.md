## SESSION 14

## FINAL PROJECT: DUE 12/17

Have your final project set up for live exhibition and playtesting at the beginning of our class on 12/17.   
Since this is a physical computing class, you must be physically present and exhibit your project in class to receive full credit.   

## Final Deliverables:
* PDF file uploaded to your gitHub repo that includes:   
  * a final brief description of your project:
    * What is the project concept? 
    * How do you use it? 
    * How is it working technically?  
  * 3 photos (at least) documenting the completed project.

* Final code submitted to GitHub as "FinalProject_title".

* A short video sent via Discord (or email) documenting the project in action. This does not need to be a fancy, edited, or high production video, but it should be of a quality that you can use within your portfolio.
