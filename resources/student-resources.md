_If your esp32 dev board keeps crashing, becomes completely unresponsive, or you are no longer able to upload any sketch to it, we can put it in Bootloader Mode:_   
1. Unplug microUSB cable to power off board.
2. Hold down BOOT button.
3. Continue to hold down BOOT button, plug in microUSB cable to UART port.
4. Press RESET while still holding down BOOT.
5. Release RESET, then release BOOT. 
6. The board should now be ready for firmware upload. I recommend flashing a simple sketch such as a serial "hello world" test or LED blink to confirm normal operation.
