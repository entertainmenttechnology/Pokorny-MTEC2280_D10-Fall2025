# GLOSSARY OF PHYSICAL COMPUTING TERMINOLOGY
Work in Progress

## A
### [Analog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal)
An electrical signal that is a continuous voltage over time. Its name is due to it being analogous to some other quantity (for example: sound waves converted to audio voltage by microphone).
### [Ampere (Unit)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere)
The unit of measurement for electrical current. Commonly referred to as Amps. Abbreviated as "A". 
## B
### [Breadboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard)
A board of reguarly spaced holes and their associated rows that allows for the prototyping of electronic circuits without soldering. Conductive plates beneath the rows allow for electrical connection based on component placement.
## C
### [Current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current)
The amount of electricity flowing through the circuit. A measurement of electron flow. Indicated by an "I" for intensity. Measured in Amperes, or Amps (A).
## D
### Digital

## E
### [Electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity)
The flow of electrons through a conductive material.

## I
### IC
### I/O

## L
### [LED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode)
L.E.D. = Light Emitting Diode

## M
### Microcontroller
### Multimeter

## O 
### Ohm (Unit)
### Ohm's Law
Voltage = Current x Resistance   
V = IR



## P
### Parallel (Circuit)

## R
### Resistance
### Resistor

## S
### Serial (Communication)
### Series (Circuit)
### SOC

## V
### Voltage
### Volt (Unit)
